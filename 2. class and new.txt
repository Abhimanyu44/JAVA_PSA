FUNCTION CALL() ---(request) ---> 'FUNCTION' ---(generates) ---> 'OUTPUT'



# 'New' makes a request to the 'class' to generate 'object or instance'.
# Thus as many times 'new' is called, it will request the 'class' to generate 'object'.
# This 'object' is saved in the 'RAM'.
# Once the 'object' is created 'new' keyword will get the 'objects address' and store that in a 'reference variable'.
#  

An example: 
    class A {

        A a1 = new A ();
    
    }

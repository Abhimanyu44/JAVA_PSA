# Packages In Java:
    - Packages in Java is nothing but a folder's created to store program in organized manner.
    - Example1:
        package pac1;
        public class A{
            
        }   

    - If there is more than one class present in the same package then importing is not required.
    - But if the classes are present in the different packages then importing is required using 'import' keyword.
    - Example1(same and diff package with inheritance):
        package p1; //Using package 'p1'.   
        public class A{
        }

        package p1; //Using package 'p1'.
        public class B extends A{
            //no error since class 'A' and 'B' are present in same package 'p1'. 
        }

        package p2; //Using package 'p2'.
        import p1.A; //importing package 'p1'.
        public class C extends A{
            //now we will not get any error. 
        }

    - Example2(same and diff package without inheritance):
        package p1;
        public class A{
        }

        package p1;
        public class B{
            psvm(){
                A a1 = new A();
            }
        }

        package p2;
        import p1.A;
        public class C{
            psvm(){
                A a1 = new A();
            }
        }

    - Example3(same and diff package without inheritance):
        package p1;
        public class A{            
        }

        package p1;
        public class B{
            psvm(){
                A a1 = new A();
            }
        }

        package p2;
        import p1.*; // importing all the classes from package 'p1'.
        public class C{
            psvm(){
                A a1 = new A();
                B b1 = new B();
            }
        }

    - Example4(same and diff package without inheritance):
        package p1; 
        public class A{
            public void test1(){
                S.o.p("Class A from package p1");
            }
        }

        package p2; 
        public class A{
            public void test2(){
                S.o.p("Class A from package p2");
            }
        }

        package p3; 
        public class B{
            psvm(){
                p1.A a1 = new p1.A(); //from package 'p1'. 
                p2.A a2 = new p2.A(); //from package 'p2'.

                a1.test1();
                a2.test2();
            }
        }
